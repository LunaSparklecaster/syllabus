Unit2  - Exploring JavaScript (Integers/Strings/Lists)
---

### **Excercise**

In a Node.js shell:

* Add, subtract, multiply, divide and exponentiate 9 and 3
* Concatenate "koala" and "bear" with a space in between them
* Put an integer list into a variable, add the second to the first and store it back into the first element
* Put a string list into a variable, concatenate the second to the first and store it back into the first element
* Append two new elements to the back of each list
* Remove the second and third element to create a new list

* Make a list with five elements, 'koalas', 'are', 'are', 'arr', 'cute'
* Extend the list with another list ['and', 'so', 'are', 'sloths']
* Append the string '!'
* Now count the number of occurances of the word 'sloths', 'koalas', and the word 'are'
* Remove the third and fourth element
* Create a string by joining all remaining elements and putting a space in between them
* Sort the array
* Reverse the array

* Create a list of lists, one of strings and the other of strings.  Show the third elements in each.
