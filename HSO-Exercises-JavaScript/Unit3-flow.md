In a Node.js shell:

* For each element in the list ["koala", "koala", "koala", "sloth", "koala"], print it out with the string "s are cute!" appended to each.
* For each element in the list ["koala", "koala", "koala", "sloth", "koala"], print it out with the string "s are cute!" if it's a sloth and
  print "s are kinda cute" if it's a koala.


* While the list ["koala", "koala", "koala", "sloth", "koala"] is not empty, remove the first element and print it out
* While the list ["koala", "koala", "koala", "sloth", "koala"] is not empty, remove the first element but only print it out if it's a sloth

* Print out the numbers from 5 to 111
* Print out the numbers from 5 to 111 but only if they're divisible by 5 or 3 but not both.
